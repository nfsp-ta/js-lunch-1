# JavaScript Lunch &amp; Learn -  Part 1

This repository contains the outlines and code samples that Omar and Ashley used for the 12/11/2020 Lunch & Learn on Modern JavaScript

While 6 topics were originally planned, time only allowed for the first 3 to be covered, thus the remaining material is being moved out to 'Part 2'

## Topics Covered

- [`const`/`let` vs. `var`](const-let/README.md)
- [Arrow Functions](arrow-functions/README.md)
- [Template Literals](template-literals/README.md)

## Source Material / More Information

The Lunch & Learn was designed as a quick intro and overview of the topics.
But time is a major limiting factor.
Thus the goal is for everyone to do their own research and explore these very interesting and useful topics.
To that end, here are references to some of the source material used in putting together the presentation, along with highly recommended extra material.
